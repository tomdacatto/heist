# heist v3 (latest)

> This code uses the "**Vesta**" base, which also [Evict](https://evict.bot) & [Greed](https://greed.best) use.

> The code is unbelievably dogshit, full of AI slop and actual retarded mechanisms. 

No instruction will be given on how to run any of this, nor it is recommended to run for your own use.

Original credits for this base go to the "**Vesta**" authors, one of them being [Sam](https://github.com/parelite).
